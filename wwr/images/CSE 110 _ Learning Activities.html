    <h2>W06 Learning Activity (2 of 2): Data in Files</h2>

    <h3>Prepare</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>In this lesson, you will continue applying all the topics of this semester as you work with data in files.</p>

    <h4>Preparation Material</h4>
    <p>For the most part, you know all the topics you need to complete this lesson. But, there is one additional
      strategy that may be helpful.</p>

    <h4>Finding the Max or Min</h4>
    <p>Recall from previous lessons that a way to find the largest number in a list is to keep track of the largest
      number found to date, and then update that value if you find a new one that is larger. For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="python hljs language-python">
numbers = [<span class="hljs-number">42</span>, <span class="hljs-number">25</span>, <span class="hljs-number">18</span>, <span class="hljs-number">83</span>, <span class="hljs-number">23</span>, <span class="hljs-number">85</span>, <span class="hljs-number">38</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>]

largest_so_far = numbers[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> number <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> numbers:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> number &gt; largest_so_far:
        <span class="hljs-comment"># This number is larger than the largest we had seen so far</span>

        <span class="hljs-comment"># So it is now the largest we've seen</span>
        largest_so_far = number

<span class="hljs-comment"># Now, after the loop we can display it:</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f"The largest is: <span class="hljs-subst">{largest_so_far}</span>"</span>)
</code></pre>

    <p>This produces the following output:</p>

    <pre><code class="plaintext hljs language-plaintext">
The largest is: 85
</code></pre>

    <p>It is important to remember to start the <code>largest_so_far</code> variable at either the first value (assuming
      it's not an empty list) or else something that you know will be smaller than everything in your list. Otherwise,
      you won't consider some numbers. For example, if you started it at 10, then you would never consider anything less
      than 10.</p>

    <h4>Keeping track of the item that is the Max or Min</h4>
    <p>What if you want to know not only which number is the largest, but also the item that is the largest? For
      example, you may want to know not only the most expensive price in your shopping cart, but the actual product that
      is the most expensive. The logic above will only find the largest value. To find the largest item, you'll also
      need to keep track of its name or value along the way.</p>

    <p>Consider the following list of products in a shopping cart, along with their prices:</p>

    <pre><code class="python hljs language-python">
shopping_cart = [
    [<span class="hljs-string">"Chips"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2.99</span>],
    [<span class="hljs-string">"Bread"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2.50</span>],
    [<span class="hljs-string">"Milk"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3.19</span>],
    [<span class="hljs-string">"Ice Cream"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6.99</span>],
    [<span class="hljs-string">"Cheese"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5.99</span>],
    [<span class="hljs-string">"Candy bar"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0.99</span>]
]
</code></pre>

    <p>In order to find the most expensive price, we can iterate through it as before:</p>

    <pre><code class="python hljs language-python">
max_price = -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> shopping_cart:
    price = item[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] <span class="hljs-comment"># The price is the second part of the item</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> price &gt; max_price:
        <span class="hljs-comment"># This is the new max</span>
        max_price = price

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f"The maximum price is: <span class="hljs-subst">{max_price}</span>"</span>)
</code></pre>

    <p>This produces the following output:</p>

    <pre><code class="plaintext hljs language-plaintext">
The maximum price is: 6.99
</code></pre>

    <p>If we want to find the name of the item that is the most expensive, we need to declare a variable (for example,
      <code>max_product</code>) before the loop to keep track of the <em>product</em> that had the maximum price. Then,
      whenever we update the max_price to save a new price, we also update the max_product to be the corresponding
      product name. For example:</p>

    <pre><code class="python hljs language-python">
max_price = -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>
max_product = <span class="hljs-string">""</span> <span class="hljs-comment"># It doesn't matter what you set this to, it just needs to be declared</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> shopping_cart:
    product_name = item[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] <span class="hljs-comment"># Product name is the first part</span>
    price = item[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] 

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> price &gt; max_price:
        <span class="hljs-comment"># This is the new max</span>
        max_price = price

        <span class="hljs-comment"># Also save this product name as the max product</span>
        max_product = product_name

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f"The maximum price is: <span class="hljs-subst">{max_price}</span>"</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f"The product with the maximum price is: <span class="hljs-subst">{max_product}</span>"</span>)
</code></pre>

    <p>This produces the following output:</p>

    <pre><code class="plaintext hljs language-plaintext">
The maximum price is: 6.99
The product with the maximum price is: Ice Cream
</code></pre>


    <h4>Other Code with Loops and Files</h4>
    <p>In addition to the code samples you've seen here, keep in mind that you can use all of the other components you
      have learned throughout the semester in conjunction with files. For example, if you wanted to restrict your
      analysis of products to only those that had a price over a certain amount, or that had a name matching certain
      criteria, you can include an if statement in the middle of the loop that is iterating through the file.</p>

    <p>In many ways, this lesson is the culmination of all the building blocks that you've learned this semester and
      brings them all together.</p>

    <p>In this activity, you will continue practicing working with <code>if</code> statements, using even more
      complicated programs and logic.</p>

    <h3>Activity Instructions</h3>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Practice finding elements in a list.</p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>To simplify your program to focus on the task at hand, instead of reading from a file, please copy and paste the
      following list of people and their ages into your program:</p>

    <pre><code class="python hljs language-python">
people = [
    <span class="hljs-string">"Stephanie 36"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"John 29"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"Emily 24"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"Gretchen 54"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"Noah 12"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"Penelope 32"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"Michael 2"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"Jacob 10"</span>
]
</code></pre>

    <p>Write a program to find the youngest person in the list.</p>

    <p>Consider following these steps to build up to the finished program:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Iterate through the list and display each string to the screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Split the string into a name and age and print them to the screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Find the age that is the youngest.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Keep track of the name of the person that is the youngest.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Sample Solution</h4>
    <p>When your program is finished, please view a sample solution of this program to compare your approach to that
      one.</p>

    <p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first, without looking at the sample solution. However, if
      you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having problems, you may feel free to use the sample
      solution to help you finish your program.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse110-ww-course/week06/samples/prepare_people_sample_py.html" target="_blank">Sample solution</a></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Testing Procedure</h4>
    <p>Because there is no user input, you don't need to test the program with different values. Instead, make sure that
      that following components are in place:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The list of people is included in the program.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The program can iterate through each string in the list.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The program can split the string into the appropriate pieces.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The youngest age is identified.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The name of the youngest person is identified.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
